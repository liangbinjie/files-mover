# Move files by its type

Files mover

Move files according to its type of file `(example: jpg, png, txt, etc)` from one directory to a new one.

To start using it, just download the `exe` file.

> *How to use*

*See Preview.png*

Provide the directory from where the files are and provide the directory where you want those files to go, and just type which type of files you want to move, for example `jpg, png, txt, py, etc`

If you add a dot before the type of file, it won't work, 
*Just type for example: `jpg` **NOT** `.jpg`*
