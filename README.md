# Move files by its type

Files mover

Move files according to its type of file (example: jpg, png, txt, etc) from one directory to a new one

> *How to use*

Provide the directory from where the files are and provide the directory you want those files to go, and just type which type of files you want, for example `jpg, png, txt, py, etc`

If you add a dot before the type of file, it won't work, 
*Just type like `jpg` **NOT** `.jpg`*
